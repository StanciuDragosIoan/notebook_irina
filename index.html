      <p class="text center bold">Object Oriented Programming - the basics</p>
      <p class="text">
        <span class="snippet">Object Oriented Programming</span> (OOP) is one of
        the most well-knowns <span class="snippet">programming paradigms</span>.
        It is so well known, that you have undoubtedly encountered it. As well
        known as it is, it can quickly become over complicated, so for a
        high-level view we will simply say that
        <span class="snippet">OOP</span> revolves around the idea of using
        <span class="snippet">objects</span> to
        <span class="snippet">model</span> real world things that we want to use
        in our programs.
      </p>

      <p class="text">
        Objects contain related data and functionality for our object. For
        instance if we want it to do certain things, our object will contain
        some methods for that. On the other hand if we want our object to store
        data, we will need to define data onto them. Objects therefore
        <span class="snippet">encapsulate</span> functionality and allow us to
        better structure and re-use that functionality throughout our
        applications.

        Object Oriented Programming - defining an object blueprint
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Let's consider a simple program that displays the users in a game.
        Beside users, it will also display game masters. Both users and game
        masters are types of 'persons' so a good first step, would be to define
        a Person class first. A person class representation would look like
        this:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
        //pseudo-code class Person
        Name[firstName, lastName]
        Age
        Hobbies: []
        Greeting: {'Hello, I am a [Name] and my hobbies are [Hobbies]'}
      </pre>

      <p class="text center bold">
        Object Oriented Programming - Creating actual objects from the blueprint
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Now that we have a class created, we can
        <span class="snippet">instantiate</span> it, so we can create objects
        from it. These objects contain data and functionality defined in the
        class. Going back to our previous representation, we can create objects
        like this:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
        //pseudo-code class Person
        Name[firstName, lastName]
        Age
        Hobbies: []
        Greeting: {'Hello, I am a [Name] and my hobbies are [Hobbies]'}

        //instantiate person1
        Name[Johny Smith]
        Age: 18  
        Hobbies: [cooking, reading, sports]
        Greeting: {'Hello, I am Johnny Smith and my hobbies are cooking, reading, sports.'}

        //instantiate person2
        Name[Kate Johnson]
        Age: 19 
        Hobbies: [dancing, music, drawing]
        Greeting: {'Hello, I am Kate Johnson and my hobbies are dancing, music, drawing.'}
      </pre>
      <p class="text">
        *note when an object is created from a class, the class
        <span class="snippet">constructor function</span> is run to create the
        object. This process is called instantiation and the constructor can
        further configure the newly created object at runtime to add it more
        properties or change some of them in some convenient way for us.

      <p class="text center bold">Specialist classes</p>
      <p class="text">
        For our program we don't need regular persons, we need users and
        gameMasters. These are just more specific types of people (so of
        instances of the Person class). These specialised classes are known as
        <span class="snippet">child</span> classes or
        <span class="snippet">sub classes</span> as they can be made to
        <span class="snippet">inherit</span> the
        <span class="snippet">parent class</span> (in this case the Person
        class). Furthermore, if we want additional functionality for the
        <span class="snippet">sub-classes</span>, so some functionality that
        does not exist in the <span class="snippet">parent class</span> we can
        just implement it.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Let's see what the user and gameMaster classes would look like:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
        //pseudo-code class Person
        Name[firstName, lastName]
        Age
        Hobbies: []
        Greeting: {'Hello, I am a [Name] and my hobbies are [Hobbies]'}


        //pseudo-code class User
        Name[firstName, lastName]
        Age
        Avatar
        Hobbies: []
        Skills: []
        gameStatus
        Greeting: {'Hi there, I am a [gameStatus] and my skills are [Skills]'}

        //pseudo-code class gameMaster
        Name[firstName, lastName]
        Age
        Avatar
        Hobbies: []
        Skills: []
        gameStatus
        Greeting: {'Greetings, I am a [gameStatus] and my role is to watch over how other game users behave'}
      </pre>
      <p class="text">
        *this is very useful, both users and gameMasters share common features
        from the Person class (such as name and age) so it is convenient to have
        to define them only once. We can also define the same feature
        differently in a sub class (so note how the greeting is different for
        users and gameMasters). There is a fancy word describing how multiple
        objects can implement the same functionality in slightly different ways
        and that's called <span class="snippet">polymorphism</span>.

    <div class="note">
      <p class="text center bold">OOP in JavaScript</p>
      <p class="text">
        Finally time to get our hands dirty and play around with objects and OOP
        in JavaScript. JavaScript uses
        <span class="snippet">constructor functions</span> to define and
        initialize objects and configure them. This is very useful because in
        our applications we come across use cases where we don't know how many
        objects we'll have to create. Constructors allow us to create as many
        objects as needed and configure them accordingly.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Let's see a simple example for defining a Person class using a normal
        function:
      </p>
      <pre class="code">
        function createNewPerson(name) {
          const obj = {};
          obj.name = name;
          obj.greeting = function() {
            alert(`Hello there, my name is ${name}`);
          };
          return obj;
        }
      </pre>
      <p class="text">We can now create objects by calling this function:</p>
      <pre class="code">
        const myAwesomePerson = createNewPerson('Awesome');
        myAwesomePerson.name;
        myAwesomePerson.greeting();
      </pre>
      <p class="text">This works good enough for</p>
